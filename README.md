# AudioFrequencyPlayer

- The user can enter an audio frequency within the range 1 - 24000.
- After the user enters the sound frequency, the app plays a note at that frequency for 500ms.

##Observations:
1. There are couple of good open source libraries which handles this very well. But I have written this just to work on the task. 

We have used sine waveform for this particular example. But there are some other types of waveforms such as square, sawtooth etc.. If needed, can accommodate that implementation as well.
